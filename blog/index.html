    <h3>Quick Read: If you don't have enough energy to read the whole blog, you can <a href="#part1">read Part 1 only</a> or check out this <em>"AI generated summary"</em></h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this post, I dive into how AI is reshaping art—using Studio Ghibli’s style as an example—by challenging elitist views and addressing concerns about creativity and art theft. I reflect on a personal midnight snack story to highlight how accessible art has become, argue that AI is simply a new tool for creative expression, and emphasize that innovation in art has always built upon what came before. Ultimately, I celebrate the democratization of art and encourage everyone to embrace these new creative possibilities.</p>

    <h2>Part 1:</h2>
    <p>I'll start with a little story from yesterday. Last night, I was hit with a serious snack craving around midnight (<em>yeah, I know I should fix my sleep schedule</em>). So I tossed some potatoes into an automated chopper, threw the slices into an air fryer, and, well, well... I had my midnight french fries. And honestly? <strong>In that moment, they tasted like heaven.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Now, if you're an art snob, you might say that I didn’t really cook. Because, obviously, unless I’m using a wood-fired oven, harvesting ingredients from a farmer named Ghalib who sings lullabies to his potatoes, hand-grinding spices, and slow-roasting everything over an open flame for twelve hours—<strong>I’ve apparently committed a crime against cuisine.</strong></p>
    
    <p>But let’s be real: <strong>this narrow-minded, elitist mentality, where only “real” art is valued, is toxic.</strong> Back when photography emerged, traditional painters panicked about their craft being replaced. Today, AI art faces similar criticism, even though it’s simply a <em>new tool</em> that allows creative expression. A camera doesn’t automatically make someone a great photographer, and likewise, AI doesn’t instantly create an amazing artist—but when paired with vision, it can produce incredible results.</p>
    
    <p>If you're still with me, consider this: if technology enables more people to see themselves in a certain style—like Studio Ghibli’s—<strong>why hate the idea of people being happy?</strong></p>

    <h2>Part 2:</h2>
    <p>Now, I wanna address the <em>“elephant in the room”</em> about the question of <em>“stealing art.”</em> This is the big one and probably the most misunderstood part of the AI art debate.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Yes, some AI models have been trained unethically—with copyrighted artwork scraped from the internet without permission. That’s a serious issue, and artists have every right to be upset. <strong>Consent and proper attribution matter.</strong></p>

    <p>However, not every use of AI is stealing. Lumping all AI-generated art under the same accusation oversimplifies a much more nuanced discussion. <strong>There’s a difference between the tool and how it’s used.</strong> Just like a camera can capture a moment or be misused to plagiarize, AI can generate something original based on prompts or, if misused, copy an exact style.</p>

    <p>If someone creates Ghibli-style art for fun—<em>imagining themselves in a whimsical world</em> without copying a specific scene—that’s fan art. Art has always evolved by borrowing and adapting techniques from one another. After all, <strong>you can’t copyright a vibe, a color palette, or a brushstroke.</strong></p>

    <p>So, when AI generates art inspired by a style without copying exact elements, it isn’t stealing—<strong>it’s creativity at work.</strong></p>

    <h2>Part 3:</h2>
    <p>In the end, this shift in art doesn’t change the passion of true art lovers. For instance, <strong>I have a soft spot for vinyl records</strong>—even though I can stream music for free, I still pay for a record. Similarly, while many people enjoy high-end, handcrafted items like Momotaro Jeans, it doesn’t mean they discredit more accessible alternatives.</p>

    <p><strong>More accessibility means more people can enjoy and contribute to art</strong>, while those with a taste for the premium can still seek out their <em>“pure art.”</em> The advent of AI in art is just another example of how creativity is expanding its reach—<strong>proving that art, in all its forms, is for everyone.</strong></p>
