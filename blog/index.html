      <h3>Quick Read: AI Generated Summary</h3>
      <p>If you don't have enough energy to read the whole blog, you can <a href="#part1">read Part 1 only</a> or check out the summary below:</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this post, I dive into how AI is reshaping art—using Studio Ghibli’s style as an example—by challenging elitist views and addressing concerns about creativity and art theft. I reflect on a personal midnight snack story to highlight how accessible art has become, argue that AI is simply a new tool for creative expression, and emphasize that innovation in art has always built upon what came before. Ultimately, I celebrate the democratization of art and encourage everyone to embrace these new creative possibilities.</p>

    <!-- Part 1: The Personal Story & Critique of Elitism -->
    <article class="post" id="part1">
      <h2>Part 1: My Midnight Snack and a Call Against Elitism</h2>
      <p>I'll start with a little story from yesterday. Last night, I was hit with a serious snack craving around midnight (yeah, I know I should fix my sleep schedule). So I tossed some potatoes into an automated chopper, threw the slices into an air fryer, and, well, well... I had my midnight french fries. And honestly? In that moment, they tasted like heaven.</p>
      <p>Now, if you're an art snob, you might say that I didn't really cook. Because, obviously, unless I’m using a wood-fired oven, harvesting ingredients from a farmer named Ghalib who sings lullabies to his potatoes, hand-grinding spices, and slow-roasting everything over an open flame for twelve hours—I’ve apparently committed a crime against cuisine.</p>
      <p>But let’s be real: this narrow-minded, elitist mentality, where only “real” art is valued, is toxic. Back when photography emerged, traditional painters panicked about their craft being replaced. Today, AI art faces similar criticism, even though it’s simply a new tool that allows creative expression. A camera doesn’t automatically make someone a great photographer, and likewise, AI doesn’t instantly create an amazing artist—but when paired with vision, it can produce incredible results.</p>
      <p>If you're still with me, consider this: if technology enables more people to see themselves in a certain style—like Studio Ghibli’s—why hate the idea of people being happy?</p>

    <!-- Part 2: Addressing the “Elephant in the Room” -->
    <article class="post">
      <h2>Part 2: Addressing the “Elephant in the Room”</h2>
      <p>Now, I wanna address the “elephant in the room” about the question of “stealing art.” This is the big one and probably the most misunderstood part of the AI art debate.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Yes, some AI models have been trained unethically—with copyrighted artwork scraped from the internet without permission. That’s a serious issue, and artists have every right to be upset. Consent and proper attribution matter.</p>
      <p>However, not every use of AI is stealing. Lumping all AI-generated art under the same accusation oversimplifies a much more nuanced discussion. There’s a difference between the tool and how it’s used. Just like a camera can capture a moment or be misused to plagiarize, AI can generate something original based on prompts or, if misused, copy an exact style.</p>
      <p>If someone creates Ghibli-style art for fun—imagining themselves in a whimsical world without copying a specific scene—that’s fan art. Art has always evolved by borrowing and adapting techniques from one another. After all, you can’t copyright a vibe, a color palette, or a brushstroke.</p>
      <p>So, when AI generates art inspired by a style without copying exact elements, it isn’t stealing—it’s creativity at work.</p>

    <!-- Part 3: Broadening the Discussion on Art & Accessibility -->
    <article class="post">
      <h2>Part 3: The Broader Perspective on Art and Accessibility</h2>
      <p>In the end, this shift in art doesn’t change the passion of true art lovers. For instance, I have a soft spot for vinyl records—even though I can stream music for free, I still pay for a record. Similarly, while many people enjoy high-end, handcrafted items like Momotaro Jeans, it doesn’t mean they discredit more accessible alternatives.</p>
      <p>More accessibility means more people can enjoy and contribute to art, while those with a taste for the premium can still seek out their “pure art.” The advent of AI in art is just another example of how creativity is expanding its reach—proving that art, in all its forms, is for everyone.</p>
